# AWS-Projects
Hello, World!

This is where I’ll be sharing my hands-on projects as I work towards becoming a Junior Cloud or DevOps Engineer. I’ve always had a passion for technology, and I’m now focused on breaking into the cloud computing space, exploring how cloud solutions and automation can solve real-world problems. As I continue learning and building my cloud computing and DevOps skills, I’ll be posting various AWS-related projects, including infrastructure setup, automation, and scripting. These projects represent my journey to gain real-world experience, refine my skills, and demonstrate my ability to tackle cloud and DevOps challenges.

Feel free to explore my work, offer feedback, or collaborate with me on new ideas—this is just the beginning of an exciting path into the tech industry!
